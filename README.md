# EmotionMIL: An End-to-End Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Emotion Recognition from EEG Signals

# The code will be released once the paper is accepted.

## Overview

![Framework](https://github.com/yuty2009/emotionmil/blob/main/figures/framework.png)
**The EmotionMIL framework for emotion recognition from multi-channel EEG signals**. (a) EEG signal segmentation and preprocessing. (b) Temporal mixer layer for capturing temporal dependencies within EEG segments. (c) Spatial mixer layer for capturing spatial dependencies between EEG channels. (d) EEGMixer for instance feature extraction. (e) Multiple instance pooling layer for aggregating instance features and predicting the overall emotion label. (f) Detailed Rettention-based MIL pooling layer.
